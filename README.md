# classification-learning
Some simple machine learning classification using logistic regression. It is very easy to get 100% classification from the datasets, so additional experimentation of using less features and less data points was explored.

## Datasets
The datasets are found in `binary/data` and `multiclass/data` for binary and multiclass classification.

## Running the notebooks
To run the notebooks, install dependencies in `requirements.txt`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run jupyter
```
jupyter-notebook
```
